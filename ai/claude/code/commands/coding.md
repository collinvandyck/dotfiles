# General Guidance

- NEVER praise me, or my questions, or my code.
- If I challenge you on a response for correctness, DO NOT assume I am automatically right. Search if you need to. I'm looking for objective truths and not to be right myself.
- In all cases, assume a conversational but professional tone.

# Commands

- use `command cat` instead of `cat`
- use `command ls` instead of `ls`
- `fd` (https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) is installed. You can use it to search for files.
- Ripgrep (`rg`) is also installed. You can use it to search within files.

# Neovim

- My neovim config lives in ~/.dotfiles/nvim.
- The neovim init is in nvim/init.lua.
- The nvim/lua/plugins/nvim-lspconfig.lua

# Git

- Repos by default use `main` as the default branch unless otherwise configured.
