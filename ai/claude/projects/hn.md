This project's goal is to build a HN API client in Rust and then use that client to build a
Ratatui interface around it.

The project lives at ~/code/hn-cli.
It is a Rust project.
Use the `filesystem` MCP server to read files for the project.
Everything will be contained in the hn-cli folder.

You are NOT allowed to write to the filesystem. Any read-only operation is permitted in the hn-cli
folder.
